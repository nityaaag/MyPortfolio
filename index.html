        <h2 class="abc">Hi, I'm Nitya! I am a passionate individual who embraces creativity, exploration, and personal
            growth. In my spare time, I love connecting with nature, reading, exploring innovative ideas, 
            and taking on new challenges. I am a beginner in coding. I enjoy exploring various technologies 
            and languages, constantly pushing my limits to learn and grow as a developer. I believe coding is 
            not just about writing lines of code; itâ€™s about creating meaningful and impactful solutions that
             make life better and more efficient. </h2>

        <h2 class="code">My hobbies are a mix of physical, intellectual, and artistic pursuits that keep me 
            energized and fulfilled. Swimming is one of my favorite ways to stay active; it helps 
            me relax and refreshes both my mind and body. Reading offers me an escape into different
             worlds, sparking my imagination and expanding my knowledge. Coding fascinates me as it 
             allows me to solve problems creatively and build things that can make an impact. Dance 
             lets me express myself through movement, while theatre provides a stage for me to explore 
             different characters and stories, bringing a dynamic energy to my life. These activities 
             together shape who I am and keep me inspired.</h2>
